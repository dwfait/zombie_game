# Zombie Game

## Overview
An as of yet unnamed game dubbed "zombie game" written in C++ using the SFML graphics library.

The game will be two-dimensional top down survival game, placing you as a sole survivor in a post apocolyptic city facing hordes of zombies and grotesque mutations. 

You must scavenge for supplies and materials and create your own personal fortress to protect you from the hordes of undead that walk the streets, and seek you out at night.

## Implementation
Current feature being implemented is the map generation. After all, how can you lay traps to slaughter countless undead if there is no smoking and scarred post-apocalyptic city in which to do so?
